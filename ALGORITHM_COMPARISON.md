## Algorithm Characteristics

### FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Simple and fair
- ‚úÖ No starvation
- ‚úÖ Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Poor performance (highest seek time)
- ‚ùå No optimization of head movement
- ‚ùå Can cause wild swings across the disk

**Best Used For:**
- Systems where fairness is more important than performance
- Low disk traffic scenarios

---

### SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Best average performance
- ‚úÖ Minimizes seek time
- ‚úÖ Good for high traffic

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Can cause starvation of far requests
- ‚ùå Not optimal in all cases
- ‚ùå Unfair to distant requests

**Best Used For:**
- Batch processing systems
- When performance is critical
- Moderate to high disk traffic

---

### SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Good performance
- ‚úÖ No starvation
- ‚úÖ Predictable behavior
- ‚úÖ Fair distribution

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Longer wait for requests just missed
- ‚ùå Not optimal for all patterns
- ‚ùå Middle tracks serviced more frequently

**Best Used For:**
- General purpose systems
- Real-time systems
- When fairness and performance both matter

---

### C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ More uniform wait times
- ‚úÖ No starvation
- ‚úÖ Better for heavy loads
- ‚úÖ Predictable performance

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Extra overhead from return sweep
- ‚ùå Slightly worse than SCAN in some cases
- ‚ùå Wastes the return trip

**Best Used For:**
- Heavy disk traffic
- When uniform response time is important
- Systems requiring predictable latency

## When to Use Each Algorithm

### Choose FCFS if:
- Fairness is the primary concern
- Disk traffic is very light
- Simplicity is important

### Choose SSTF if:
- Performance is critical
- Starvation is not a concern
- Disk traffic is moderate to high
- Running batch jobs

### Choose SCAN if:
- Need balance between performance and fairness
- Running a general-purpose OS
- Predictable behavior is important
- Real-time requirements exist

### Choose C-SCAN if:
- Need uniform wait times
- Running heavy workloads
- Want to avoid bias towards middle tracks
- Consistency is more important than raw performance

## Real-World Applications

### Operating Systems Usage

- **Linux**: Uses variants of SCAN (C-LOOK)
- **Windows**: Uses a form of SCAN
- **Modern SSDs**: Often use different algorithms due to no physical seek time

### Simulation Scenarios to Try

1. **Sequential File Access** (Sequential scenario)
   - Best: FCFS or SCAN
   - SSTF performs similarly

2. **Random Access Pattern** (Random scenario)
   - Best: SSTF
   - Worst: FCFS

3. **Clustered Access** (Clustered scenario)
   - Best: SSTF or SCAN
   - Good for simulating database operations

4. **Heavy Load** (Large request count)
   - Best: C-SCAN or SCAN
   - Most consistent performance

## Performance Tips

1. **For Teaching/Learning**: Start with FCFS to understand basics, then compare with SSTF
2. **For Performance Analysis**: Use same request set across all algorithms
3. **For Real-World Simulation**: Use Clustered scenario with 15-20 requests
4. **For Stress Testing**: Use Random scenario with 30+ requests

## Expected Behavior Patterns

**Low Request Count (< 10)**
- SSTF usually wins
- FCFS performs poorly with scattered requests

**Medium Request Count (10-20)**
- SCAN and SSTF are competitive
- C-SCAN shows consistent performance

**High Request Count (> 20)**
- C-SCAN becomes more beneficial
- FCFS performance degrades significantly

**Clustered Requests**
- All algorithms perform better
- SSTF advantage decreases

**Sequential Requests**
- FCFS performs well
- All algorithms show similar results
